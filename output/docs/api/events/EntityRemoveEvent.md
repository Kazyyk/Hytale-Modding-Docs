# EntityRemoveEvent

> Package: `com.hypixel.hytale.server.core.event.events.entity`
> Extends: `EntityEvent<Entity, String>`
> Implements: `IEvent<String>`
> Cancellable: No
> Key type: `String`

Dispatched when an entity is removed from the world. This is a lifecycle event that fires during entity removal and cannot be cancelled -- by the time listeners receive it, the removal is committed.

Because the key type is `String`, this event is dispatched with a keyed dispatch. Listeners can filter by the entity's type key.

## Fields / Accessors

| Field | Type | Accessor | Mutable | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| `entity` | `Entity` | `getEntity()` | No | The entity being removed from the world. Inherited from `EntityEvent`. |

## Fired By

- `Entity.remove()` (line 113) via `eventBus.dispatchFor()` -- keyed dispatch when an entity is removed from the world.

## Listening

```java
getEventRegistry().register(EntityRemoveEvent.class, event -> {
    Entity entity = event.getEntity();
    // Perform cleanup when an entity is removed
});
```

## Related Events

- [`AddPlayerToWorldEvent`](./AddPlayerToWorldEvent.md) -- for player entities, this is the corresponding "add" event. `EntityRemoveEvent` covers all entity types, not just players.
